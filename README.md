# Wield A +1 Sword of JS
Although Javascript is the default tool of the web, it has broken in the heat of many a battle. By applying ES6 and ES7, the crafty developer can turn a brute javascript club into a +1 longsword of web mastery. Though these skills must be earned through trial, the brave will embark on this quest.

To craft such a weapon, first the aspiring adventurer must study the map to identify treasures (code clarity, classes, decorators, etc). The wise will be ever wary of dangerous traps along the path (shifting standards, varied support, etc). Next, the seeker must master the rituals of Babel and Webpack. Upon achieving mastery, the adventurer can complete the quest, gaining not only a powerful new weapon, but also the wisdom to wield it in their daily life.

The time has come - venture out, craft your sword, and wield the power.
